# Research overview

## Technology and International Development

As a software engineer at Google,
I worked with the Access Strategy &amp; Operations team 
(originally part of [Google.org](http://www.google.org/)
on sustainable solutions to access problems in developing regions.
Examples of the team's projects (in collaboration with many other teams 
at Google) included 
pilots of mobile data tools (SmartBrowse) in Ghana and
TVWS in [South Africa](http://www.tenet.ac.za/tvws).
The StratOps team developed plans for network deployments (access
strategy) and helped execute those that move forward (operations).
These ranged from the fairly conventional [metro fiber
backhaul](https://web.archive.org/web/20170119042025/https://www.google.com/get/projectlink/)
in Uganda and Ghana, [urban Wi-Fi
networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RailTel_Corporation_of_India#Free_WiFi_at_stations)
in India, [satellite-fed
CDN](https://web.archive.org/web/20170510191158/https://www.youtube.com/yt/accelerator/)
in Southeast Asia) to the
[extremely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneWeb_satellite_constellation#History)
[risky](https://9to5google.com/2017/01/11/alphabet-titan-cut/). We
had to model everything from orbital patterns, wireless link budgets 
and network traffic up to local consumer economics.

As a research scientist at Intel, I worked on
[TIER](https://web.archive.org/web/20171010013334/tier.cs.berkeley.edu),
a project in which Intel collaborated with U.C. Berkeley on the design
of appropriate **technology for emerging regions**.  Various TIER
sub-projects had connections with Intel's former Emerging Markets
Platforms Group (EMPG).  My published research was based on fieldwork
in Ghana and Kenya and a field visit to Chile.

## Human-Computer Interaction and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work

My work in HCI has been highly interdisciplinary, mostly sitting in
the intersection of **mobile computing** and
**human interaction**.

I still participate in a project on **mobile participatory sensing**
called [_Common Sense_](https://www.communitysensing.org/). The team
at Intel Research explored some technical issues in sensing
environmental air quality using mobile phones, but the key problem of
interest for us as HCI researchers has been to work with partners such
as the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project
([WOEIP](http://www.woeip.org/) to understand how and why people
become engaged in citizen science and environmental activism.  (Note
that environmental degradation is a key concern in emerging regions.)

I collaborated for many years with <a
href="http://www.parc.com/">PARC</a> researchers in the sociological
discipline of conversation analysis; their detailed understanding of
human conversational structure have helped us understand how
(technologically) minor differences in a system can have dramatic
effects on interaction.

* [**Mobile audio spaces**](https://web.archive.org/web/20060209161048/http://www.parc.com/audiospaces/): 
  An example of this work is a system we nicknamed _Mad Hatter_, a
  mobile audio space designed for use by small gelled social groups.
  This work applied machine learning techniques to produce a
  conferencing system that adapts to human conversation.
* [**Design fieldwork**](https://web.archive.org/web/20060223042257/http://www2.parc.com/csl/projects/audiospaces/ptt.htm):
  As part of this work, Allison Woodruff and I analyzed some fieldwork
  on young adults using push-to-talk cellular radios, drawing on
  several perspectives in **computer-mediated communication**.
* [**_Sotto Voce_**](https://web.archive.org/web/20060209161031/http://www.parc.com/guidebooks/):
  Another example is _Sotto Voce_, a networked electronic guidebook
  system that delivers audio information in a way that facilitates
  face-to-face human interaction instead of inhibiting it.

All of this work on interaction lead to a renewed interest in
wide-area **collaborative systems**.  I spent a lot of my [time at
sea](USN/navy.html) sitting in front of networked tactical
command-and-control consoles.

Finally, I have some background in **visualization**: information
display technology, information visualization techniques and
visualization system architectures.  This came through working with
members of the [Tioga
DataSplash](https://web.archive.org/web/20000418155033/http://tioga.cs.berkeley.edu/)
database visualization project at Berkeley.

## Data Management

As part of TIER, I had the experience of architecting, building and
deploying an asynchronous data replication system for use in a
telemedicine system in Ghana (2007-2008).

I consulted (2002-2003) for the PARC security group in a project on
[privacy preservation in distributed repositories of personal
data](https://web.archive.org/web/20090713011904/http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/104421/Computerworld_Horizon_Awards_2005_Honorees).

The [Harland](https://web.archive.org/web/20060221051713/http://www.parc.xerox.com/csl/projects/harland/) project at PARC
(1999-2000) explored the programming affordances of data modelling
constructs that lie between the semistructured and (dynamic)
object-oriented data models.  Another consideration is how such
constructs can be supported efficiently.  Harland was an outgrowth of
the [Placeless Documents](https://web.archive.org/web/20060221051802/http://www.parc.xerox.com/csl/projects/placeless/) project on property-based data stores.

At Berkeley, I worked for [Mike
Stonebraker](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/michael-stonebraker) in
the [database research group](http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/) on a variety
of topics:

* **Database extension technologies**
  * [**Extensibility architectures**](http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/postgres.html)
  * [**Extensible indexing**](http://gist.cs.berkeley.edu/)
    * Support for selectivity estimation
    * Bulk-loading, reorganization, ...
    * Support for document databases
* **Parallel and** [**distributed**](https://web.archive.org/web/20000510070049/http://mariposa.cs.berkeley.edu/) **information systems**
    * Query optimization
    * Web characterization
