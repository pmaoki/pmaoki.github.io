# Personal graph theory

## [Erd&ouml;s number][enp] = 3

I was sort of surprised when I figured out that I have a finite
Erd&ouml;s number [^1]. (Fun fact: there are so many Ph.D.s at Google,
_there's an intranet badge for that_.) But I suppose it shouldn't have
been that surprising:

| 0               | 1          | 2                | 3  |
|---------------- |------------|------------------|----|
| Paul Erd&ouml;s | Pat O'Neil | Mike Stonebraker | me |

This was formerly:

| 0               | 1           | 2             | 3                | 4  |
|---------------- |-------------|---------------|------------------|----|
|                 | Pat O'Neil  | Jim Gray      | Mike Stonebraker |    |
| Paul Erd&ouml;s | Ron Graham  | Tom Leighton  | Eric Brewer      | me |
|                 | Maria Klawe | Steve Gribble | Eric Brewer      |    |

until Mike Stonebraker published a paper with some better-connected
people, putting him into [this equivalence class][enp1] of over 11,000
people. Now, to shorten this chain, it would be necessary for me to
write a paper with someone in [this set][enp0] of 511 people...a set
that is now, unfortunately, monotonically decreasing in size (as well
as largely Hungarian to begin with).

For a while, I had a smaller Erd&ouml;s number than [Paul
Dourish][jpd], who writes a seemingly infinite number of papers.
Unfortunately, he figured out together that he had written papers with
people who had actually written theory papers, as opposed to people
who had written papers with people who had written papers with theory
people; and then he figured out [an even shorter path][jpderdos]
later.

## Academic lineage

Back when Berkeley CS moved out of Evans Hall, I noticed a discarded
copy of my advisor's dissertation in the hallway and used that to add
an entry for [him][mgpmike] in the [Mathematics Genealogy
Project][mgp] database. So you can trace a lineage from [me][mgpaoki]
(and a bunch of other random database systems researchers) back to 17th
Century Germany.

(But I am a math poseur. My uncles [Togo][mgptogo] and [Eizo][mgpeizo]
are the real mathematicians in the family.)
