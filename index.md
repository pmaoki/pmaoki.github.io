# In brief

I'm a research scientist by trade, currently on a self-funded
sabbatical to study the mathematics underlying machine learning
[^1]. Previous positions include:

|
|:-|:-|:-|:-:|
| senior software engineer | Google | [Google][google] |
| senior staff research scientist | Intel Research Berkeley | [Intel][intel] |
| member of research staff | Computer Science Laboratory | [Xerox PARC][parc] |
| Ph.D. | [Computer Science][ucbcs] | U.C. Berkeley |
| surface warfare officer | [USS _MERRILL_ (DD 976)][usn] | U.S. Navy |
| B.S. | [Electrical Engineering][ucbee] | U.C. Berkeley |

# Research areas

I've [published][publications] and [reviewed][service] research papers
on topics including human-computer interaction, computer-supported
cooperative work, international development, and sociolinguistics;
ubiquitous computing and sensing systems; and database and distributed
systems. Much of this work has involved a substantial amount of [data
science and GIS work][data].

This is covered in more detail [here](.admin/overview.html).

[^1]: I don't just mean, &ldquo;[how does backprop
      work][backprop]&rdquo; -- that's just the first stop of the deep
      learning hype train. Well, yes, [I've been riding that train,
      too][cs231n]. But I've also been wading into stuff like
      [optimization][ee263], [Fourier analysis][m131b], and
      [mathematical statistics][m164] that were not fashionable for
      computer scientists when I was in school.
